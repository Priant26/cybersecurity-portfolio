# Intro to LAN (TryHackMe)

## Overview
This lab introduced the fundamentals of Local Area Networks (LAN) and how devices communicate within a shared network environment.

## What I learned
- What a Local Area Network (LAN) is
- The purpose of IP addresses and MAC addresses
- How devices identify and communicate with each other on a network
- The basic role of switches and routers in a LAN

## Tools used
- TryHackMe guided lab environment
- Browser-based AttackBox

## What I practiced
- Understanding how devices are connected in a LAN
- Identifying how data moves between devices
- Learning how networking concepts apply to real systems

## Why this matters
LAN knowledge is foundational in cybersecurity because understanding how devices communicate is essential for monitoring traffic, detecting issues, and securing networks.
