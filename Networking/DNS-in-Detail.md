# DNS in Detail (TryHackMe)

## Overview
This lab explained how the Domain Name System (DNS) works and how it translates user-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand.

## What I learned
- What DNS is and why it is important for the internet
- How DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses
- The roles of DNS resolvers, root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative name servers
- Key DNS record types, including:
  - A / AAAA records: map domains to IP addresses
  - CNAME: alias one domain to another
  - MX: mail server records
  - NS: name server information
  - TXT: text or verification records
  - PTR: reverse lookup records
- How DNS caching improves speed and reduces lookup time

## What I practiced
- Performing DNS lookups
- Viewing DNS records for different domains
- Understanding how DNS traffic flows through the network
- Identifying how DNS can be misused in attacks

## Why this matters
DNS is a major part of how the internet works, and it is also a common target in cyberattacks.  
Understanding DNS helps with troubleshooting, detecting suspicious activity, and securing networks.
