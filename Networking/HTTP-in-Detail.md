# HTTP in Detail (TryHackMe)

## Overview
This lab explained how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) works and how web browsers and servers communicate on the internet.

## What I learned
- What HTTP is and how it supports web communication
- The difference between HTTP and HTTPS
- Common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Common status codes (200, 301, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- How headers, cookies, and sessions work
- Why HTTP is important for web security

## What I practiced
- Understanding how HTTP requests and responses are structured
- Looking at how data moves between a client and a server
- Seeing how websites use cookies and sessions to track users

## Why this matters
HTTP is the foundation of how websites work.  
Many cyberattacks target HTTP traffic, login forms, cookies, and data being sent over the web.  
Understanding HTTP is essential for troubleshooting, security monitoring, and web-based attack defense.
