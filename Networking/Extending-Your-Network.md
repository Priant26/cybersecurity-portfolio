# Extending Your Network (TryHackMe)

## Overview
This lab covered how networks are extended beyond a local environment and explained key security technologies used to protect traffic.

## What I learned
- What port forwarding is and why it’s used to allow external access to internal devices
- How firewalls control and filter network traffic using rules
- The basics of VPNs and how they create secure, encrypted connections
- How different network devices work together to expand and protect a network

## What I practiced
- Understanding how firewall rules allow or block traffic
- Learning how VPNs secure data over the internet
- Exploring how port forwarding exposes services on a network
- Analyzing how LAN devices communicate across extended networks

## Why this matters
These concepts are essential in cybersecurity because real-world networks rely on firewalls, VPNs, and controlled access to stay secure. Understanding how networks extend outside a LAN helps identify risks, secure communication, and troubleshoot issues.
