# How Websites Work (TryHackMe)

## Overview
This lab explained how a website loads and how a browser communicates with a web server.

## What I learned
- The difference between the **client** (browser) and the **server**
- How DNS, HTTP, and the server all work together to load a website
- What **frontend** code is (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- What **backend** systems do (logic, processing, database actions)
- How the browser requests files and the server responds with content

## What I practiced
- Understanding the basic flow of loading a webpage
- Seeing how browsers request HTML, CSS, images, and scripts
- Learning how the frontend and backend work together

## Why this matters
Most cyberattacks target websites and web traffic.  
Knowing how websites work helps with troubleshooting, security monitoring, and understanding how attackers target webpages and users.
